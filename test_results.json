While scientists struggle to contain the radiation, criminal networks establish a new balance of power through the smuggling of an unknown substance. Recently released from prison, Bahadir secretly returns to the zone, caught between his past, a desire for revenge, and the criminal underworld. At the same time, police officer Ilyas follows the trail of this dark network. Science, crime, and human nature collide at a single point. The Zone becomes not only a physical threat, but a place where the darkest side of the human soul is revealed.",
